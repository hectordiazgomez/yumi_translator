# Spanish to Awajun Translator
A language translator trained using NNLB from Meta. The initial version of this repository was made using a sequence-to-sequence model to translate from Spanish to Awajun, an indigenous language spoken in the Peruvian Amazon.

## Project Status
This is the first version of the translation model. We are actively gathering more data and seeking partners to collaborate with us in order to improve the model's performance and make it a fully usable product.

## About Awajun
Awajun, also known as Aguaruna, is a language spoken by the Awaj√∫n people in the northern part of the Peruvian Amazon. It belongs to the Jivaroan language family. Awajun is an under-resourced language, and this project aims to contribute to its preservation and accessibility through machine translation.

## Data
The current version of the model is trained on a limited dataset. We are continuously working on expanding our parallel corpus of Spanish and Awajun sentences to improve the model's performance and coverage.

## Model Architecture
The translation model is based on a sequence-to-sequence architecture with attention mechanism. More details about the model architecture and training process will be provided as the project progresses.

## Contributing
We welcome contributions from the community to help us improve the Spanish to Awajun translation model. If you have parallel data in Spanish and Awajun or would like to contribute in any other way, please feel free to open an issue or submit a pull request.

## Contact
If you are interested in partnering with us or have any questions about the project, please contact us at hector.diaz@pucp.edu.pe

Note: This is a work in progress, and the model's performance may be limited at this stage. We appreciate your understanding and support as we continue to develop and refine the Spanish to Awajun translation model.
